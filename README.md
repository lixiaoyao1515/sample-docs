# Sample content for docsotron

## Goals
1. Create a simple content site that can be used to test essential features of docsotron.
1. Add enough complexity to represent all the features of a docs site while keeping things small, well explained, and clean.
1. Show best practices.
1. During transition to the new system allow this site to be build both as a nanoc/nanoc-conref-fs site and a docsotron site so we have a point of truth.

## Getting going

1. run `script/bootstrap`
1. run `script/server`
1. Hope for the best.
