title: Association example

<p class='data-association'><%= @item[:data_association] %></p>
<p class="children">
  <%= @item[:children] %>
</p>
<p>The above output would ideally include 'Older Page link'. This cannot not be done with Nanoc on its own, hubot is used to do this. A label is added to a pr and that changes the latest version in the nanoc.yml file to change the shown version.</p>
